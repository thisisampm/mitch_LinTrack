%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FROM THE TRAINING DATA %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%
% Here, we use the training data to calculate the prior probability of the 
%   rat occupying each pixel, and the firing rate maps of each cell over 
%   all pixels.
%


    %PRIOR PROBABILITY, P(S), i.e. the spatial occupancy distribution 
    %
    % P(A) = N(A) / sum(N(A))
    %
    % N(A) is the number of timesamples with the rat in pixel A
    % 
    % This is the number of timesamples with the rat in each pixel A 
    % divided by the total number of timesamples
    %  
    % This gives us a row vector length pixels
    %

        %visted pixels

        ngroups = length(glevels);

        P_A = ones(size(P_A));

    
    %FIRING RATE MAPS, f(x), i.e. tuning curve distribution
    %
    % f(x) is the mean firing rate observed in each pixel A for each cell
    %
    % This gives us a matrix pixles*cells
    %

        %preallocate

        %Poisson distributions (below) do not work with an expected value

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FOR THE SAMPLE DATA %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%
% Here, we use the above calculated distributions to calculate the
%   conditional, P(B|A), and then the posterior, P(A|B), for the sample 
%   data.
%
    
    %CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY, P(B|A), i.e. the likelihood
    %
    % This is the probability for the firing rates B to occur given that 
    %   the animal is in pixel A. If we assume that the rates have 
    %  	Poisson distributions (are as random as possible in time) and 
    %  	that different cells are statistically independent of one another, 
    %  	then we can obtain the explicit expression:
    %
    %           P(B|A) = multiply_over P(Bi|A)
    %               and
    %           P(Bi|A) = multiply_over (((tao*fi(A))^Bi)/Bi!)*e^(-tao*fi(A))
    %
    % Here, P(B) is not explicitly calculated, but is obtained by
    % 	assuming that P(A|B) must equal 1.
    %
    % This gives us a matrix sample_timesamples*pixels
    %

        %preallocate
        P_B_A_cell = nan(nsamp, ngroups, ncells); %each time window

        %expected number of spikes (tao * average firing of each
        %cell in each pixel)
        e_spikes = f_x*tao;
        
        %for each timestamp, calculate the conditional probability at each pixel for each cell
        %
        %may be able to cut 10s by using a 3d matrix instead of a loop
        %
        for tsamp = 1:nsamp

            %observed number of spikes (at this time sample, resized to 
            %match e_spikes)
            o_spikes = repmat(sample(tsamp, :), ngroups, 1);
            
            %fill conditional matrix
            %
            %This computes whole matrices at once for efficiency.
            %Transposed to make multiplication (below) easier.
            %
            %P_B_A_cell_p1(tsamp, pixel, :) = ((e_spikes^o_spikes)/factorial(o_spikes))*exp(-e_spikes);
            P_B_A_cell(tsamp, :, :) = exp(o_spikes.*log(e_spikes)...
                -e_spikes-gammaln(o_spikes+ones(size(o_spikes)))); %equivalent and more stable
            
        end

        %multiply across cells
        P_B_A = prod(P_B_A_cell, 3);

    %posterior probability, P(A|B)
    %
    % The reconstruction is based on the standard formula of conditional 
    %	probability: P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A) / P(B)
    %
    % Merging the above distributions gives us the formula for the posterior:
    %
    %       P(A|B) = P_A * P_B_A_cell * C(tao,B)
    %
    % Where C(tao,B) is a normilazation factor, such that sum(P(A|B)) is equal to 1.
    %
    % This gives us a matrix sample_timesamples*pixles
    
        %replicate rate map for each time sample
        P_A = repmat(P_A, nsamp, 1);

        %multiply at each timestamp and pixel
        P_A_B = P_A .* P_B_A;


        %apply correction, C(tao,B)
        for tsamp = 1:nsamp
            P_A_B(tsamp, :) = P_A_B(tsamp, :)./sum(P_A_B(tsamp, :));
        end

    %outputs
    %
    posterior = P_A_B;
    [~, class] = max(P_A_B, [], 2);%highest probability pixel
    origin_pixels = unique(group);
    class = origin_pixels(class);
